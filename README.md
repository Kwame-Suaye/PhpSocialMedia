# PhpSocialMedia

This started as a very simple login system I made back when I was learning about databases and SQL. Well, after some time coding in php, I wanted to challenge myself and come up with a big project (given my experience and skill level at that time), so why not take something I coded myself and make it 1000x better? So that's exactly what I did :D

Over at my website you can find a whole arcticle I wrote about it, with a bunch of cool pictures and a whole walkthrough of what my thought process was and how I got around to solving the main issues I came across.
